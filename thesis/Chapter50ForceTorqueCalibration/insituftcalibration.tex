\begin{abstract}
This paper proposes techniques to calibrate six-axis force-torque sensors that can be performed \emph{in situ}, i.e., without removing the sensor from
the hosting 
system. 
We assume that the force-torque sensor is attached to a rigid body equipped with an accelerometer. Then, the proposed calibration 
technique uses the measurements of the accelerometer, but
% do not 
requires neither the knowledge of the inertial parameters 
% mass and the center of mass 
% of the rigid body 
nor the orientation
% , with respect to gravity, 
of the rigid body. 
The proposed method exploits the geometry induced by the model between the raw measurements of the 
sensor and the corresponding force-torque. 
% Furthermore, it does not require the knowledge of the mass and center of mass of the body to which the force-torque sensor is attached.
The validation of the approach is performed by calibrating two six-axis force-torque sensors of the iCub humanoid 
robot.
