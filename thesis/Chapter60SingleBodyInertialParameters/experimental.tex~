\section{EXPERIMENTS}
\label{experiments}
To test the proposed method, we calibrated the two force-torque sensors embedded in the leg of the iCub humanoid robot 
-- see Figure~\ref{fig:iCubLeg}. The mass and the center of mass of this leg are unknown.

To apply the method described in section~\ref{method}, we need to add sample masses to the iCub's leg.
For this purpose, we installed on the robot's foot a beam to which samples masses can be easily attached. This beam also houses a XSens MTx IMU.
This supplementary accelerometer will no longer be required when using
 the iCub version 2, which will be equipped with 50 accelerometers 
distributed on the whole body. 
The iCub's knee is kept fixed with a position controller, so we can consider the robot's leg as a unique rigid body.
Consequently, the accelerometer measures the gravity force w.r.t. both sensors.  Recall also that 
to apply the proposed methods, we need to modify the orientations of the sensors' frames. To do so, we modified the \emph{front-back} and
\emph{lateral} angles associated with the robot's hip.

We collected data associated with eight different added masses configurations, in which of each the mass was placed at a different 
location with respect to the beam. In other words, 
we collected eight different data sets. Figures \ref{fig:calibration} and~\ref{fig:validation_masses} show the configurations of these data sets.

For each of these data set, we slowly\footnote{The iCub front-back and lateral angles were moved with peak velocities of $2 \deg/s$.} 
moved the \emph{front-back} and
\emph{lateral} angles, spanning a range of $70 \deg$ for the \emph{front-back} angle, and a range of $90 \deg$ for the lateral angle. 
We sampled the two F/T sensors and the accelerometer at 100 Hz, and we filtered the obtained signals with a Savitzky-Golay filter of third order 
with a windows size of 301 samples.

 with the method described in \ref{offsetEstimationTechnique} is the center of this ellipsoid.

 \label{ellipsoidWithRawData}
\end{figure}



We estimated the sensors' offsets by applying the method described in section~\ref{offsetEstimationTechnique} on all eight data sets. 
Figure~\ref{ellipsoidWithRawData} verifies the statement of Lemma~1, i.e. the raw measurements belong to a three dimensional ellipsoid. 
In particular, this figure shows the measurements
$r_i$ projected onto the three dimensional space where the ellipsoid occurs, i.e. the left hand side of the equation~\eqref{rFromModel1}. 
Then, we removed the offset from the raw measurements to apply the estimation method for the calibration matrix described in 
section~\ref{calibrationMatrixEstimation}.

The two sensors' calibration matrices were identified by using only four data sets -- see Figure~\ref{fig:calibration}. 
The other four were used to validate the obtained calibration results -- see Figure~\ref{fig:validation_masses}.
% Four of these were used for applying the method described in the previous section, and the other
% four for validating this method -- 
The validation of the calibration procedure is based on the following fact. Since the weight of the leg is constant for each data set, if we plot
the force measure by the sensors, i.e. the first three rows of the sensor's equation
\[ w = C(r + o), \]
these forces must belong to a sphere, since they represent the (constant norm) gravity applied to the sensors.
As for elements of comparisons, we can also plot the first three rows of the above equation when evaluated with the calibration matrix that was 
originally provided by the
manufacturer of the sensors.

\label{fig:validation}
\end{figure}

Figures~\ref{fig:validation} plot the force measured by the sensor with the estimated calibration matrix (in green)
and with the calibration matrix provided by the manufacturer (in red). It is clear to see that the green surfaces are much more spherical than the red ones.
As a matter of fact, Table \ref{table:soa} lists the semiaxes of the ellipsoids plotted in Figures~\ref{fig:validation}, and clearly shows 
that the green surfaces represent spheres much better than the red ones. 
Interestingly enough, the force-torque sensor embedded in the iCub leg is much more mis-calibrated than that embedded in 
the foot. In fact, by looking at the data sheets describing the technological lives of these sensors, we found out that the force-torque sensor embedded in
the leg is much older than that in the foot, which means that also the calibration matrix of the leg's sensor is much older than that of the foot's sensor.

Table \ref{table:mass} shows the quality of the calibration by using the validation dataset for estimating the weight of the sample masses attached to the leg. Both calibrated sensors (at the foot and at the upper leg) are able to give a good estimations of the masses and the improvement with respect to the manufacturer calibration matrix is significant. A similar comparison was conducted on the estimation of the sample mass position (Table \ref{table:cmass}). Also in this significant improvement can be seen when using the calibrated matrix as opposed to the original manufacturer calibration. It has to be noticed that the errors in estimating the mass position are relatively high but this is due to the choice of using relatively small masses with respect to the sensor range and signal to noise ratio.
