\label{sensors}

In the previous chapter, we lied the theoretical background underling the dynamics of multibody systems. The next chapters will instead focus on specific estimation and identification algorithms developed and validated on the iCub humanoid robot. 
In particular, in this section we will do a brief review of all the sensors that will be used in the next chapter, and their relationship to the quantities that we define in the previous chapters. For a detailed description of the underling physical principles, the interested reader is referred to \citep[Chapter 4]{doebelin2003}.
