abstract = {we present methods for velocity estimation from discrete and quantized position samples using adaptive windowing. Previous methods necessitate tradeoffs between noise reduction, control day, estimate accuracy, reliability, computational load, transient preservation, and difficulties with tuning. In contrast, a first-order adaptive windowing method is shown to be optimal in the sense that it minimizes the velocity error variance while maximizes the accuracy of the estimates , requiring no tradeoff. Variants of this method are also discussed. The effectiveness of the proposed technique is verified in simulation and by experiments on the control of a haptiv device.},

@article{Seth2010,
abstract = {Biomechanical systems share many properties with mechanically engineered systems, and researchers have successfully employed mechanical engineering simulation software to investigate the mechanical behavior of diverse biological mechanisms, ranging from biomolecules to human joints. Unlike their man-made counterparts, however, biomechanisms rarely exhibit the simple, uncoupled, pure-axial motion that is engineered into mechanical joints such as sliders, pins, and ball-and-socket joints. Current mechanical modeling software based on internal-coordinate multibody dynamics can formulate engineered joints directly in minimal coordinates, but requires additional coordinates restricted by constraints to model more complex motions. This approach can be inefficient, inaccurate, and difficult for biomechanists to customize. Since complex motion is the rule rather than the exception in biomechanisms, the benefits of minimal coordinate modeling are not fully realized in biomedical research. Here we introduce a practical implementation for empirically-defined internal-coordinate joints, which we call "mobilizers." A mobilizer encapsulates the observations, measurement frame, and modeling requirements into a hinge specification of the permissible-motion manifold for a minimal set of internal coordinates. Mobilizers support nonlinear mappings that are mathematically equivalent to constraint manifolds but have the advantages of fewer coordinates, no constraints, and exact representation of the biomechanical motion-space-the benefits long enjoyed for internal-coordinate models of mechanical joints. Hinge matrices within the mobilizer are easily specified by user-supplied functions, and provide a direct means of mapping permissible motion derived from empirical data. We present computational results showing substantial performance and accuracy gains for mobilizers versus equivalent joints implemented with constraints. Examples of mobilizers for joints from human biomechanics and molecular dynamics are given. All methods and examples were implemented in Simbody™-an open source multibody-dynamics solver available at https://Simtk.org.},

abstract = {The new generation of service robots requires force control to safely cooper- ate with humans in unstructured dynamic environments. The objective of this thesis was to improve the abilities of humanoid robots to interact with their surrounding. In particular, the idea of integrating force and touch feedback was investigated, so as to control the robot in presence of external forces act- ing on any part of its body. To this aim, this work exploited the humanoid robot iCub as test platform, and it tackled three main issues: i) spatial cali- bration of tactile sensors, ii) estimation of contact forces using tactile sensors and force/torque sensors, and iii) prioritized position and force control. The main contribution of this thesis is a new framework for prioritized position and force control of floating-base robots. The framework was com- pared to other state-of-the-art similar frameworks, both analytically and in simulation, and it proved preferable in terms of optimality and computational efficiency — twice as efficient, while preserving the optimality of the solu- tion. Moreover, a method for estimating the 3D positions of tactile sensors was proposed. The method relies on force/torque measurements and it was exploited to calibrate the 1500 tactile sensors mounted on the arms of the iCub robot, with an average error of approximately 7 mm. Another method was introduced, which makes use of the calibrated tactile sensors, together with the distributed force/torque sensors, to estimate an arbitrary number of contact forces acting on any part of the robot's body. The method is based on the Recursive Newton-Euler Algorithm, and it was implemented as part of the open-source C++ library iDyn. Furthermore, a theoretical and empirical analysis investigated how incorrect estimation of contact points may affect the resulting contact forces and induce undesired joint accelerations. Tests on the iCub robot demonstrated a significant improvement in the performance of the force controller when the tactile system was used. All things considered, this work advanced the state of the art of force control of humanoid robots, providing estimation methods and control strategies that can be applied to make robots safely work side-by-side with humans.},

This paper analyzes currently existing force sensing techniques concluding that a joint torque sensing technique will results the best performance in a force servo system. A new, simple, high again, wide bandwidth torque servo system using a joint torque sensor system has been developed and has been verified by using a single joint manipulator.

Tests are developed as independent plug-ins to be loaded and executed by an automated tool. Moreover, a fixture manager prepares the setup (e.g., running robot drivers or simulator) and actively monitors that all the required resources are available before and during the execution of the tests. These functionalities effectively accelerate the development process and cover different levels of robotic system testing. The paper describes the framework and provides realistic examples to show how it has been used to support software development on our robotic platform.},

abstract = {Human motion tracking is a powerful tool used in a large range of applications that require human movement analysis. Although it is a well-established technique, its main limitation is the lack of estimation of real-time kinetics information such as forces and torques during the motion capture. In this paper, we present a novel approach for a human soft wearable force tracking for the simultaneous estimation of whole-body forces along with the motion. The early stage of our framework encompasses traditional passive marker based methods, inertial and contact force sensor modalities and harnesses a probabilistic computational technique for estimating dynamic quantities, originally proposed in the domain of humanoid robot control. We present experimental analysis on subjects performing a two degrees-of-freedom bowing task, and we estimate the motion and kinetics quantities. The results demonstrate the validity of the proposed method. We discuss the possible use of this technique in the design of a novel soft wearable force tracking device and its potential applications.},

abstract = {Given an articulated rigid body, we define the problem of estimating its dynamics as the problem of computing all the forces and accelerations acting on the bodies which constitute the articulated system. Similarly, we define the state estimation problem as the problem of computing the system positions and velocities. In the present paper we propose a framework for simultaneous state and dynamics estimation. The estimation is framed in a Bayesian framework and a suitable Bayesian prior is defined to guarantee the physical consistency of the obtained estimation. The Bayesian posterior makes use of all available measurements which include encoders, gyroscopes, accelerometers, force and torque sensors. The proposed theoretical framework is validated both on simulation and on the iCub humanoid. The software that implements the theoretical framework is realised with an open-source license.},

Since our plugins conform with the YARP layer used on the real robot, applications written for our robots, COMAN and iCub, can be run on the simulator with no changes. Our plugins have two main components: a YARP interface with the same API as the real robot interface, and a Gazebo plugin which handles simulated joints, encoders, IMUs, force/torque sensors and synchronization. Different modules and tasks for COMAN and iCub have been developed using Gazebo and our plugins as a testbed before moving to the real robots.},

The motivation for this effort is the conviction that significantly greater impact can be leveraged by adopting an open systems policy for software and hardware development. This creates the need for a robust humanoid robot that offers rich perceptuo-motor capabilities with many degrees of freedom, a cognitive capacity for learning and development, a software architecture that encourages reuse {\&} easy integration, and a support infrastructure that fosters collaboration and sharing of resources. The iCub satisfies all of these needs in the guise of an open-system platform which is freely available and which has attracted a growing community of users and developers. To date, twenty iCubs each comprising approximately 5000 mechanical and electrical parts have been delivered to several research labs in Europe and to one in the USA.},

abstract = {In the literature on robotics and multibody dynamics, the concept of average angular velocity has received considerable attention in recent years. We address the question of whether the average angular velocity defines an orientation framethat depends only on the current robot configuration and provide a simple algebraic condition to check whether this holds. In the language of geometric mechanics, this condition corresponds to requiring the flatness of the mechanical connection associated to the robotic system. Here, however, we provide both a reinterpretation and a proof of this result accessible to readers with a background in rigid body kinematics and multibody dynamics but not necessarily acquainted with differential geometry, still providing precise links to the geometric mechanics literature. This should help spreading the algebraic condition beyond the scope of geometric mechanics,contributing to a proper utilization and understanding of the concept of average angular velocity.},

abstract = {This paper proposes techniques to calibrate six-axis force-torque sensors that can be performed in situ, i.e., without removing the sensor from the hosting system. We assume that the force-torque sensor is attached to a rigid body equipped with an accelerometer. Then, the proposed calibration technique uses the measurements of the accelerometer, but requires neither the knowledge of the inertial parameters nor the orientation of the rigid body. The proposed method exploits the geometry induced by the model between the raw measurements of the sensor and the corresponding force-torque. The validation of the approach is performed by calibrating two six-axis force-torque sensors of the iCub humanoid robot.},

The proposed condition ensure both the positive definiteness and the triangular inequality of 3D inertia matrices as opposed to existing techniques in which the triangular inequality constraint is ignored. This paper presents also a new parametrization that naturally ensures that the inertial parameters are fully physical consistency. The proposed parametrization is exploited to reformulate the inertial identification problem as a manifold optimization problem, that ensures that the identified parameters can always be generated by a physical body. The proposed optimization problem has been validated with a set of experiments on the iCub humanoid robot.},

abstract = {Lie groups, Lie algebras, and representation theory are the main focus of this text. In order to keep the prerequisites to a minimum, the author restricts attention to matrix Lie groups and Lie algebras. This approach keeps the discussion concrete, allows the reader to get to the heart of the subject quickly, and covers all of the most interesting examples. The book also introduces the often-intimidating machinery of roots and the Weyl group in a gradual way, using examples and representation theory as motivation. The text is divided into two parts. The first covers Lie groups and Lie algebras and the relationship between them, along with basic representation theory. The second part covers the theory of semisimple Lie groups and Lie algebras, beginning with a detailed analysis of the representations of SU(3). The author illustrates the general theory with numerous images pertaining to Lie algebras of rank two and rank three, including images of root systems, lattices of dominant integral weights, and weight diagrams. This book is sure to become a standard textbook for graduate students in mathematics and physics with little or no prior exposure to Lie theory.

abstract = {The classic text on robot manipulators now covers visual control, motion planning and mobile robots too!Robotics provides the basic know-how on the foundations of robotics: modelling, planning and control. The text develops around a core of consistent and rigorous formalism with fundamental and technological material giving rise naturally and with gradually increasing difficulty to more advanced considerations.The theory of manipulator structures presented in the early part of the book encompasses:{\^{a}} the fundamentals: kinematics, statics and trajectory planning; and{\^{a}} the technology of actuators, sensors and control units.Subsequently, more advanced instruction is given in:{\^{a}} dynamics and motion control of robot manipulators;{\^{a}} mobile robots;{\^{a}} motion planning; and{\^{a}} interaction with the environment using exteroceptive sensory data (force and vision).Appendices ensure that students will have access to a consistent level of background in basic areas such as rigid-body mechanics, feedback control, and others. Problems are raised and the proper tools established to find engineering-oriented solutions rather than to focus on abstruse theoretical methodology. To impart practical skill, more than 60 examples and case studies are carefully worked out and interwoven through the text, with frequent resort to simulation. In addition, nearly 150 end-of-chapter problems are proposed, and the book is accompanied by a solutions manual (downloadable from www.springer.com/978-1-84628-641-4) containing the MATLAB{\^{A}} code for computer problems; this is available free of charge to those adopting Robotics as a textbook for courses. This text is suitable for use in senior undergraduate and graduate courses in automation and computer, electrical, electronic and mechanical engineering courses with strong robotics content.},

abstract = {The most obvious choice for a robot design to assist in people's homes with daily tasks is a huma- noid bipedal robot. Such a robot can operate in the human living space just as a human would do. Accurate knowledge about the parameters of a model for a bipedal humanoid robot is needed to control such a robot. The design of stable walking gaits is based on such a model. A lot of humanoid control strategies use the center of mass (CoM) model as an approximation for the balance of the robot. The projection of the CoM on the ground corresponds to the center of pressure (CoP) if the robot is static, i.e. stable and not moving. This CoP can be determined from measurements of the ground contact forces of the robot. A method to estimate the unknown parameters of the CoM model is derived. For this, the 3D CoM model of the humanoid robot TUlip is rewritten to a form suitable for estimation. The method uses measurements of the CoP and joint angles of the robot for a number of static postures. The identifiable parameter combinations using these measurements are determined. A number of measurement postures which are feasible on the humanoid robot TUlip are derived. These postures fulfill a number of constraints, such as mechanical limits of the robot and a stability limit. The stability limit ensures that the robot is balanced and does not fall over. These postures are optimized to increase the accuracy of the estimated parameters. The static estimation method is first tested using simulation data. After that the measurement postures are implemented on TUlip. The measurements of the centers of pressure and joint angles for these postures are used to estimate the CoMparameters of TUlip. The joint angles are measured using TUlip's joint encoders. The CoP is measured by placing the robot on measurement boards, which are able to measure the ground contact forces. The accuracy of the parameter values, estimated using the experimental data, is determined using a statistical analysis. This shows that the estimation results look reliable for the most important parameters. The parameters of a simplified CoM model are also estimated. A number of parameters are eliminated in this simplified model. Using the simplified model the CoP can be predicted almost as accurately as with the full model. The parameter estimation method is extended to also include the dynamic parameters of the robot. For this the zero moment point (ZMP) model is used. The ZMP model is a model for the CoP for a dynamic robot. The identifiable combinations of parameters are derived for this model. The dynamic method again uses measurements of the CoP and joint angles of the robot. Now the joint velocities and accelerations are also used as the dynamic parameters are estimated. This dynamic estimation method is tested using simulation data. For these simulations existing motions of TUlip are used. These motions are forward walking, side stepping and turning around a point. The estimation results show that the existing motions are too slow to estimate all dynamic parameters accurately. I},

abstract = {Accurate calibration of joint offsets is a crucial requirement for effective kinematic and dynamic control of robots. Such calibration is typically carried out using cumber- some and time-consuming procedures. We propose a technique for joint offset calibration using the measurements from a distributed set of on-board accelerometers. Differently from existing techniques, we do not assume that the accelerometers are perfectly calibrated. The calibration procedure consist in a two steps automatic procedure : the first step calibrates the accelerometer measurements, while the second one computes the optimal joint offsets. The only constraint required for the kinematic chain calibration trajectory is to follow a sequence of static poses or to move under negligible robot acceleration and slow speed. The proposed approach was validated on a position control problem on the iCub humanoid robot.},

abstract = {Analysis, design and control of multibody systems rely on dynamical models that de- scribe the relationship between forces acting on the bodies and the resulting motion. A dynamical model is characterized by the inertial parameters of the bodies composing the system which, in case of rigid bodies, are: masses, positions of centers of mass and rotational inertias. Inertial parameters can be computed from CAD models, but this approach often results in a poor quality of the dynamical model. Alternatively, dynamic parameters can be estimated on real systems through motion and force measurements. This thesis tackles the problem of the online estimation of inertial parameters, using the iCub humanoid robot as test platform. We review, under a unifying framework, various approaches to inertial parameter estimation, each characterized by the type of force measurements that it uses. We analyze the problem of non-identifiability of the inertial parameters, reporting the related results from the literature. Moreover, we present a method for numerically characterizing the confidence of the estimation, moving the focus from the estimated parameters to the quantities that we want to compute using them. Based on this theoretical analysis, we implemented a C++ open-source software for online estimation of inertial parameters. Tests on the arm of the iCub robot validated the presented software, showing an improvement with respect to the inertial parameters computed from the CAD model of the robot.},

We regulate the forces between the robot and its surrounding environment to stabilize a desired posture. We assume that the forces and torques are exerted on rigid contacts. The validity of this assumption is guaranteed by constraining the contact forces and torques, e.g., the contact forces must belong to the associated friction cones. The implementation of this control strategy requires the estimation of both joint torques and external forces acting on the robot. We then detail algorithms to obtain these estimates when using a robot with an iCub-like sensor set, i.e., distributed six-axis force-torque sensors and whole-body tactile sensors. A general theory for identifying the robot inertial parameters is also presented. From an actuation standpoint, we show how to implement a joint-torque control in the case of DC brushless motors. In addition, the coupling mechanism of the iCub torso is investigated. The soundness of the entire control architecture is validated in a real scenario involving the robot iCub balancing and making contact with both arms.},

While impedance control on lower limbs can assist in this, it is unclear how the values of stiffness and damping can be chosen. We present an approach for analytically computing the optimal impedances for completing a safe and stable foothold. The robot foot-leg behavior is modeled as a free-floating two- link system making contact with an a-priori unknown surface orientation. The optimal impedance is derived directly from minimizing a cost function based on the center of pressure (CoP) at the instant of making full ground contact. The obtained impedance is shown to be linearly dependent on the orientation of the ground, for a given desired terminal state and CoP position. Consequently the impedance can be estimated based on an expectation of ground orientation at the point of foot contact. The proposed approach is validated in a walking simulation on the full iCub humanoid robot.},

abstract = {The computation of the inertial matrix of dynamic model for manipulator using some sets of base-parameter values may be not positive definite for some configurations. Such sets of base-parameter values are physically impossible. The result of the study on physical impossibility of the set of base-parameter values could be used to judge if a set of base-parameter values, which are obtained through parameter identification or other methods, is physically impossible or not and to modify the set of base-parameter values that was judged to be physically impossible. Hence, the result would directly contribute to model-based control of manipulators or motion simulation for manipulators. In this paper, a sufficient condition for the inertial matrix to be positive definite for each configuration of the manipulator is given by use of physical inertial parameters of the links composing the manipulator. By use of this condition and a set of "virtual parameters," a scheme is given to judge if a set of base-parameter values determine the inertial matrix to be always positive definite or not.},

abstract = {Many problems in the sciences and engineering can be rephrased as optimization problems on matrix search spaces endowed with a so-called manifold structure. This book shows how to exploit the special structure of such problems to develop efficient numerical algorithms. It places careful emphasis on both the numerical formulation of the algorithm and its differential geometric abstraction-illustrating how good algorithms draw equally from the insights of differential geometry, optimization, and numerical analysis. Two more theoretical chapters provide readers with the background in differential geometry necessary to algorithmic development. In the other chapters, several well-known optimization methods such as steepest descent and conjugate gradients are generalized to abstract manifolds. The book provides a generic development of each of these methods, building upon the material of the geometric chapters. It then guides readers through the calculations that turn these geometrically formulated methods into concrete numerical algorithms. The state-of-the-art algorithms given as examples are competitive with the best existing algorithms for a selection of eigenspace problems in numerical linear algebra. Optimization Algorithms on Matrix Manifolds offers techniques with broad applications in linear algebra, signal processing, data mining, computer vision, and statistical analysis. It can serve as a graduate-level textbook and will be of interest to applied mathematicians, engineers, and computer scientists.},

@article{marsden1993reduced,
abstract = {Marsden and Scheurle [1993] studied Lagrangian reduction in the context of momentum map constraints--here meaning the reduction of the standard Euler-Lagrange system restricted to a level set of a momentum map. This provides a Lagrangian parallel to the reduction of symplectic manifolds. The present paper studies the Lagrangian parallel of Poisson reduction for Hamiltonian systems. For the reduction of a Lagrangian system on a level set of a conserved quantity, a key object is the Routhian, which is the Lagrangian minus the mechanical connection paired with the fixed value of the momentum map. For unconstrained systems, we use a velocity shifted Lagrangian, which plays the role of the Routhian in the constrained theory. Hamilton's variational principle for the Euler-Lagrange equations breaks up into two sets of equations that represent a set of Euler-Lagrange equations with gyroscopic forcing that can be written in terms of the curvature of the connection for horizontal variations, and into the Euler-Poincar{\'{e}} equations for the vertical variations. This new set of equations is what we call the reduced Euler-Lagrange equations, and it includes the Euler-Poincar{\'{e}} and the Hamel equations as special cases. We illustrate this methodology for a rigid body with internal rotors and for a particle moving in a magnetic field.},

abstract = {This paper proposes techniques to calibrate six-axis force-torque sensors that can be performed in situ, i.e., without removing the sensor from the hosting system. We assume that the force-torque sensor is attached to a rigid body equipped with an accelerometer. Then, the proposed calibration technique uses the measurements of the accelerometer, but requires neither the knowledge of the inertial parameters nor the orientation of the rigid body. The proposed method exploits the geometry induced by the model between the raw measurements of the sensor and the corresponding force-torque. The validation of the approach is performed by calibrating two six-axis force-torque sensors of the iCub humanoid robot.},

abstract = {Classically robot force control passes through joint torques measurement or estimation. Within this context, classi- cal torque sensing technologies rely on current sensing on motor windings and on torsion sensing on motor shaft. An alternative approach was recently proposed and combines whole- body distributed 6-axis force/torque (F/T) sensors, gyroscopes, accelerometers and tactile sensors (i.e. artificial skin). A further advantage of this method is that it simultaneously estimates (internal) joint torques and (external) contact forces with no need of joint redesign. As a drawback, the method relies on a model of the robot dynamics, as it consists on reordering the classical recursive Newton-Euler algorithm (RNEA). In this paper we consider the problem of the parametric identification of the robot dynamic model from embedded F/T sensors. We extend recent results on parametric identification by considering an arbitrary reordering of the classical RNEA. The theoretical framework is validated on the iCub humanoid, which is equipped with both 6-axis F/T sensors and joint torque sensors. We estimated the system inertial parameters using only one F/T sensor. We used the obtained parameters to estimate the joint torques and compared the results with direct joint torque measurements, used in this context only as a ground truth.},

The main result of the paper is to give a methodology for computing whole body dynamics by aligning a model of the system dynamics with the measurements coming from the available sensors. Three primary sources of information are exploited: (1) embedded force/torque sensors, (2) embedded inertial sensors, (3) distributed tactile sensors (i.e. artificial skin). In order to cope with external wrenches applied at continuously changing locations, we model the kinematic chain with a graph which dynamically adapts to the contact locations. Classical pre-order and post-order traversals of this dynamically evolving graph allow computing whole-body dynamics and estimate external wrenches. Theoretical results have been implemented in an open-source software library (iDyn) released under the iCub project. Experimental results on the iCub humanoid robot show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

It is also an invaluable reference text.---From a Review of the First Edition:"The majority of textbooks dealing with this subject cover various topics in kinematics, dynamics, control, sensing, and planning for robot manipulators. The distinguishing feature of this book is that it introduces mathematical tools, especially geometric ones, for solving problems in robotics. In particular, Lie groups and allied algebraic and geometric concepts are presented in a comprehensive manner to an audience interested in robotics. The aim of the author is to show the power and elegance of these methods as they apply to problems in robotics."-MathSciNet},

abstract = {Walking, running or jumping are special cases of articulated motions which rely heavily on contact forces for their accomplishment. This central role of the contact forces is widely recognized now, but it is rarely connected to the structure of the dynamics of articulated motion. Indeed, this dynamics is generally considered as a complex nonlinear black-box without any specific structure, or its structure is only partly uncovered.We propose here to precise this structure and show in details how it shapes themovements that an articulated systemmight realize. Some propositions are made then to improve the design of control laws for walking, running, jumping or free-floating motions.},

@book{Siciliano2009,
abstract = {The classic text on robot manipulators now covers visual control, motion planning and mobile robots too!Robotics provides the basic know-how on the foundations of robotics: modelling, planning and control. The text develops around a core of consistent and rigorous formalism with fundamental and technological material giving rise naturally and with gradually increasing difficulty to more advanced considerations.The theory of manipulator structures presented in the early part of the book encompasses:{\^{a}} the fundamentals: kinematics, statics and trajectory planning; and{\^{a}} the technology of actuators, sensors and control units.Subsequently, more advanced instruction is given in:{\^{a}} dynamics and motion control of robot manipulators;{\^{a}} mobile robots;{\^{a}} motion planning; and{\^{a}} interaction with the environment using exteroceptive sensory data (force and vision).Appendices ensure that students will have access to a consistent level of background in basic areas such as rigid-body mechanics, feedback control, and others. Problems are raised and the proper tools established to find engineering-oriented solutions rather than to focus on abstruse theoretical methodology. To impart practical skill, more than 60 examples and case studies are carefully worked out and interwoven through the text, with frequent resort to simulation. In addition, nearly 150 end-of-chapter problems are proposed, and the book is accompanied by a solutions manual (downloadable from www.springer.com/978-1-84628-641-4) containing the MATLAB{\^{A}} code for computer problems; this is available free of charge to those adopting Robotics as a textbook for courses. This text is suitable for use in senior undergraduate and graduate courses in automation and computer, electrical, electronic and mechanical engineering courses with strong robotics content.},
